# Skyrim Together Reborn for Modded Animations

_The Tilted Phoques Development Team only supports strictly required mods, no others._ See their disclaimers on their wiki, [here](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online)
and [here](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/guides/getting-started#readme-before-installing). If you can't reproduce an issue with nothing but the required mods installed, 
don't bother the development team.

That said, the developers have graciously included contributed, limited support for behaviors/animations mods such as those generated by Nemesis, or the newer Pandora. If you use this capability,
report issues to the author(s) of the support. Preferably file an issue with the authors on github, [here](https://github.com/rfortier/TiltedEvolution-rwf/issues), or you may find help from Ujave or MagicWizardMan on the 
Skyrim Together Reborn Discord.

However, no permission to post any variation of this fork on Nexus. For now. It's coming, there are just more things to fix first so we don't get flooded with support requests.  

# Credits
This fork is inspired by Edho08's original effort to figure out how to patch Nemesis (and now Pandora) support into TiltedPhoques Skyrim Together Reborn. 
Since then, Spvvd and Ragley have put maintenance effort into versions up to 1.5.0 of STR. This version targets the upcoming v1.6.x release of STR and adds a ton of features.
@rfortier and @MostExcellent have contributed to it. 

# Status

This version is a substantial rewrite, fixing a lot of bugs, adding flexibility that enables the STR development team and modders to work more independently without breaking each other (as much). 
It has been ported to v1.6.x-preview of Skyrim Together Reborn.

Importantly, _the goal is for it to be wire-protocol comnpatible with vanilla public STR servers._ This goal still needs to be proven. And as always, only clients with the same version and the same modlist
can connect to the same server.

Includes TDM, TUDM, Modern Combat Overhaul, Elden Counter and dragon behavior patches. Oh, and humans don't skate around.

Sometimes animations still don't sync, restarting game+server or rerunning Nemesis and syncing the output with your friends can fix it in most cases.

Tested extensively with Skyrim Version 1.6.640.0 and you can only join servers running this build of STR. It might work with the latest Skyrim and the correct address library, but it has barely been tested.
And the STR team has not released 1.6.x yet.

This version by RFortier and MostExcellent adds these goals:
* Wire protocol compatibility.
* Beast mode (werewolf, vampire lord) support.
* Pure feature branch to make it easily rebaseable. 
* Minimal intrusion in the base code.
* Feature is conditionally compiled. Enabled by a single commit in the history which will show the one(-ish) line to comment out to turn it off. Or, don't include that commit.
* In theory, if a client with modded animations support is compile to the same version as the vanilla STR, the vanilla server will support that client.
* Tries to remove as much of the complexity for modders as possible. To mod a behavior you don't need anything about the behavior variables the Dev team has chosen, nor do you need
to know the old or new hashes that will be generated by your new behaviors; the game calculates them.
That's pretty important because _every_ mod that changes behavior changes the hash, and the order of mods may also change the hash (unless you use Pandora which fixes that evil).
That means a mod author _can't_ know the new hash for the mods a user selects,
it is only known for a specific modlist in a specific order.
* It's to your advantage to know the _original STR game behavior hash_ you are moddifying, though; if you do, you only need to list the behavior variables your mod needs, 
the rest that the STR dev team selects will be picked up automatically for you. This helps give your mod STR version-independence. The SkyrimTogetherRebornBehaviors tree is pre-populated with this 
information for the creatures supported by STR.

# TODO
* Hoping to win support of the Dev team to include this in their build, which will make it easier to stay in sync with the servers.
* In the interim, compiled versions are available on [github](https://github.com/rfortier/TiltedEvolution-rwf/releases), but they will only work with the server that is included.
* Need some help figuring out an xmake change to automatically compile behavior string names when anything changes. For now, manually generated and output files checked in.
